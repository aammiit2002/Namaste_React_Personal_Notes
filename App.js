//React Element = React.createElement => is an object => when rendered in DOM it becomes an HTML element.

//But the syntax below looks very bad as it is not easy to write as compared to simple html

//Because we can build react apps with using JSX all the big apps can be built
//But JSX makes the life of developers easy
// const heading = React.createElement("h1", { id: "heading" }, "Namaste React");

//JSX IS NOT HTML INSIDE JAVASCRIPT ðŸ“ŒðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ
