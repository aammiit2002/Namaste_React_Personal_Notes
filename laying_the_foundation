We can create scripts to create dev build an app
behind the scenes, it will run our project in dev mode
"scripts: {
  "start": "parcel index.html" //We wrote this for running our app in dev mode
  "build": "parcel build index.html" //We wrote this for running our app in production mode
}
NOTE:-
now with the help of these scripts, we don't have to write these commands npx parcel build index.html etc,
we can use: npm run start(the keyword used in the script)/ npm start (this will only work for start as start is a keyword in npm won't work for build)

## React Element = React.createElement => 
is an object => when rendered in DOM it becomes an HTML element.

## But the syntax below looks very bad as it is not easy to write as compared to simple HTML
So the developers created JSX

## NOTE: JSX IS NOT A PART OF REACT, BOTH ARE DIFFERENT: Because we can build react apps using JSX all the big apps can be built
But JSX makes the life of developers easy

Q) HOW TO REACT H1 TAG INSIDE JSX?
The jsxHeading here is a react element
--> const jsxHeading = <h1>Namaste React using JSX</h1>;
ðŸ“ŒðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ JSX IS NOT HTML INSIDE JAVASCRIPT 
JSX is an HTML or XML-like syntax
