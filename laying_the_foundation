We can create scripts to create dev build app
behind the secenes it will run our project in dev mode
"scripts: {
  "start": "parcel index.html" //We wrote this for running our app in dev mode
  "build": "parcel build index.html" //We wrote this for running our app in production mode
}
NOTE:-
now with the help of these scripts we don't have to write thse commands npx parcel build index.html etc,
we can use: npm run start(the keyword used in script)/ npm start (this will only work for start as start is a keyword in npm won't work for build)
